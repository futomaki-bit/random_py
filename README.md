# random_py

Testing how random is random from 'import random'

**Requirement:**
- Python
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)

**My test:**
- Data from 0 to 99
- Repeat 10000 times

**Experimental Results:**
- Minimum occurences often near 75 times
- Max occurences often near 125 times
- Delta/Difference usually in the 40s or 50s
- Variance usually in 90s or 100s

**Theoretical Results:**
- Min = Max = 100
- Delta 0
- Variance 0

**Sample Output:**
```
Range:        83 ~ 120
Delta:        37
Theoretical:  1.0%
Variance:     97.7
```
